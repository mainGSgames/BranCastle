  "effect": "While this card is active, whenever a hero moves into a Stairwell (Catacombs, First-Floor, Second-Floor, Third-Floor) OR moves out of a Stairwell into an adjacent room, they must immediately roll a D6. On a result of 1-2, they are momentarily disoriented and their maximum movement for their next turn is reduced by 1 step (to a minimum of 1 step). Furthermore, if a hero attempts to move into a room already occupied by two or more other heroes, they cannot enter that room and their movement for the current turn immediately ends. They also lose 1 Willpower.",
