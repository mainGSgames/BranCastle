  "effect": "While this card is active, whenever a hero enters a new room (not a stairwell), they must roll a D6. On a result of 1-2, they lose 1 Sanity as their mind struggles to discern reality. Additionally, any hero ending their turn in the Blood Storage or Crypt must roll a D6; on a 1-3, unseen tendrils of mist cling to them, draining 1 Health.",
