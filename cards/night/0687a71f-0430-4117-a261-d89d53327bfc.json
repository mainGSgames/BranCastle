  "story": "The cacophony of the storm outside seems to resonate with Sade's sinister influence, allowing her seductive whispers to seep into every corner of the castle. Her vampiric hunger reaches out, draining vitality from the unwary.",
  "effect": "All heroes immediately lose 1 HP. If Sade is currently on the game board (i.e., not defeated), any hero in the First Tower Bedroom, Master Bedroom, Second Tower Bedroom, or the Library loses an additional 1 HP. If Van Helsing is in one of these specific rooms, all heroes in that room are immune to this additional HP loss.",
