  "effect": "While this card is active, heroes lose 1 Sanity at the start of each of their turns. Furthermore, any hero attempting to use an item for its active effect (e.g., healing with Holy Water, stunning with Revolver, or staking with Stakes) must first roll a D6. On a roll of 1-2, the item is fumbled, and its intended effect is negated for that turn.",
