  "effect": "While this card is active, whenever a hero moves into a new room (not a stairwell) that is currently empty of other heroes or Vampire Sisters, they must immediately roll a D6. On a result of 1-3, a terrifying apparition manifests from the mist, and the hero loses 1 Sanity. If the hero is Jonathan Harker, he loses an additional 1 Willpower. Additionally, if a hero successfully obtains an item via Memory Search, they must immediately roll a D6. On a result of 1-5, the item is consumed by the mist and removed from the game.",
