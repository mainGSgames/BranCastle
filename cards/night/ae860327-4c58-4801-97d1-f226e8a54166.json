  "effect": "While this card is active, at the start of each hero's turn, if they are in the Ballroom, Dining Room, or Great Hall, they must roll a D6. On a 1-2, they are compelled to move 1 step directly towards the Master Bedroom. If this movement is impossible (e.g., blocked by a locked door without Jonathan Harker's Key, or the target room already contains two other heroes), they lose 1 Sanity instead. This compelled movement does not count towards their regular movement for the turn. Additionally, Sade (Red Sister) gains +1 to her Combat rolls against heroes in the Master Bedroom.",
