  "effect": "While this card is active, at the start of each of their turns, any hero in the Master Bedroom or Crypt must roll a D6. On a result of 1-3, they lose 1 Sanity due to disorienting visions. Additionally, if a hero attacks a Vampire Sister and that attack misses (D6 roll 1-4, or 1-5 with items), the hero immediately loses 1 Willpower as their confidence erodes in the pervasive mist.",
