  "effect": "While this card is active, at the start of each of their turns, any hero carrying 3 or more items must immediately roll a D6. On a result of 1-2, that hero must discard one item of their choice, returning it to the item deck. Additionally, whenever a hero successfully uses an item to block an attack (e.g., Garlic, Cross) or heal (e.g., Holy Water), they lose 1 Willpower due to the draining aura.",
