  "effect": "While this card is active, whenever a hero moves into or out of any Stairwell (Catacombs, First-Floor, Second-Floor, Third-Floor), that movement costs an additional 1 step. Additionally, at the start of each of their turns, any hero in the Entrance Hall, Ballroom, or Great Hall must roll a D6. On a result of 1-2, dislodged debris strikes them, and they lose 1 Health. If Jonathan Harker is the hero affected, he loses an additional 1 Willpower due to the terrifying unpredictability.",
