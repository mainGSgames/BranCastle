  "effect": "While this card is active, whenever a hero moves into a room already containing a Vampire Sister, their movement immediately ends, and they cannot make any further movement for that turn. Additionally, if a hero performs a Combat action against a Vampire Sister and successfully hits (roll 5-6), the Sister immediately performs a counter-attack, dealing 1 damage of her type (Mary: 1 Willpower, Sade: 1 Health, Luci: 1 Sanity). This damage is applied *before* the hero can use any blocking items. If Jonathan Harker is the hero performing the Combat action, he loses an additional 1 Willpower due to the sudden fright, even if he misses.",
