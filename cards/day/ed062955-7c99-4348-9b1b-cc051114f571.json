  "effect": "For the duration of this Day phase, any movement taken *between* two different Stairwell rooms (e.g., Catacombs Stairwell to First-Floor Stairwell, or Fourth-Floor Stairwell to Third-Floor Stairwell) costs 1 movement step instead of 2. Each time a hero uses this shortcut, they must roll a D6: on a 1, they lose 1 Health.",
