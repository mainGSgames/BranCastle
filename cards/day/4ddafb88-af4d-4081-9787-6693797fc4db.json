  "story": "The heavy clouds obscure the peaks of the Carpathian mountains, yet from the castle's highest reaches, a sense of grim clarity descends upon the heroes.",
  "effect": "During this Day phase, any hero who starts their turn in the Fourth-Floor Stairwell, First Tower Bedroom, Second Tower Bedroom, or Master Bedroom may choose one: either gain +1 to their next D6 combat roll this turn, or secretly peek at the current location of one random Vampire Sister. However, at the end of any turn a hero ends in one of these rooms, they must immediately lose 1 Willpower from the chilling vigil.",
