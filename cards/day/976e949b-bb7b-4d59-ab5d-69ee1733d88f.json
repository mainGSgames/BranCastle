  "effect": "During this Day phase, heroes may perform a Memory Search in any room. However, due to the pervasive mist, Memory Searches still only succeed on a D6 roll of 6. Furthermore, if a Memory Search attempt fails, the hero immediately loses 1 Sanity from the disorienting whispers and spectral visions.",
