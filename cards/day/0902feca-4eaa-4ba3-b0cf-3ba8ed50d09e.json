  "story": "The pervasive mist swirls and shifts within the castle's ancient halls, sometimes opening ephemeral, disorienting pathways through the very stones themselves.",
  "effect": "During this Day phase, any hero may spend 1 action to instantly teleport to any Stairwell room (Catacombs, First-Floor, Second-Floor, Third-Floor, Fourth-Floor). However, immediately after teleporting, they must roll a D6: on a result of 1-2, the disorienting effects of the mist are too great, and the hero loses 1 Sanity and 1 Willpower.",
