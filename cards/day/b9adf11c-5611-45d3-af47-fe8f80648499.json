  "story": "The tempest outside forces the heroes to seek respite, but even within these 'safe' walls, the storm rattles their resolve and weakens the ancient structure.",
  "effect": "During this Day phase, any hero resting in a Bedroom (First Tower, Master, Second Tower Bedroom) or feasting in the Dining Room heals an additional 1 Health and 1 Willpower. However, each time a hero rests or feasts, they must immediately roll a D6. On a result of 1-2, a random Vampire Sister (Mary, Sade, or Luci) moves 2 steps directly towards the resting hero's room, drawn by the disturbance, and the resting hero loses 1 Sanity from the unnerving creaks and groans of the castle.",
