  "story": "The unusually fair weather illuminates forgotten corners of the castle, revealing a loose flagstone or a hidden alcove in the wall.",
  "effect": "During this Day phase, any hero in the Entrance Hall, Library, or Great Hall may spend one action to attempt to uncover an 'Unforeseen Cache'. Roll a D6: on a 4-6, they gain 1 random non-unique item (Garlic, Holy Water, Cross, Wooden Stakes, Revolver). If no such items remain in the item pool, they gain 1 Health instead. On a 1-3, they find nothing, and a random Vampire Sister (Mary, Sade, or Luci) immediately moves 2 steps directly towards the hero's current room, drawn by the disturbance.",
