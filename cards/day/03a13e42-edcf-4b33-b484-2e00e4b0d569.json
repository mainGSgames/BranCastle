  "effect": "During this Day phase, movement through any Stairwell (Catacombs, First-Floor, Second-Floor, Third-Floor, Fourth-Floor) counts as only 1 step instead of 2. However, each time a hero passes through a Stairwell, they must immediately roll a D6. On a result of 1 or 2, they lose 1 Health from falling debris or losing their footing.",
