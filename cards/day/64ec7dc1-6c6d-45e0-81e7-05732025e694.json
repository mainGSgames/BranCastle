  "effect": "During this Day phase, whenever a hero successfully heals Health by resting in a Bedroom (First Tower, Master, Second Tower) or feasting in the Dining Room, they heal +1 additional Health. Immediately after gaining this bonus Health, roll a D6: on a 1 or 2, the Vampire Sister closest to the healing hero's location moves 2 steps directly towards them. If multiple Sisters are equally close, the players choose which one moves.",
