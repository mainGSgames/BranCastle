## **1 · Introduction**

* **Genre:** Co-operative gothic horror adventure for 1–5 adult players.  
* **Objective:** Locate and destroy **Mary, Sade and Luci – the Vampire Sisters – and finally Count Dracula** before the Night Deck (60 cards) is exhausted.  
* **Tone:** Classic Bram Stoker dread spiked with tactical decision-making and a dash of gallows humour to keep your sanity dice above 1\.

## **2 · Components**

| Qty | Component |
| :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Double-sided game board showing **Bran Castle cut-away (16 numbered rooms \+ 4 stair nodes)** on one side and an abstract tactical grid on the reverse.  \*\*Room index (board reference):\*\* 1 Catacombs · 2 First Floor · 3 Second Floor · 4 Third Floor · 5 Fourth Floor · 6 Crypt · 7 Dungeon · 8 Entrance Hall · 9 Blood Storage · 10 Ballroom · 11 Dining Room · 12 Great Hall · 13 Library · 14 First Tower Room · 15 Master Bedroom · 16 Second Tower Room. |
| 160 | Memory-cards (72 item pairs, 8 trap pairs) |
| 16 | Hex room dials (values 5 → 0\) – one per room |
| 20 | Coffins (Mary, Sade, Luci, 1 Awake Dracula, 1 Sleeping Dracula, 15 blank/trap) |
| Digital | **Moon & Dawn Cards** (infinite, generated by the web-simulator) |
| 1 | Weather barometer clock (6 sectors) |
| 1 | Phase clock (*Sun/Moon face* – see board corner) |
| Dice | D6 × 5 (damage, sanity, willpower) · D16 × 1 (night spawn) |
| Tokens | 6 Hero pawns, stake markers, coffin lids |

*Pro-Tip:* Lay the board on black velvet – even Dracula appreciates good interior design.

---

## **3 · Core Loop & Phases**

| Phase | What Happens |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Dawn Phase** | Rotate the phase clock so the hand points **straight down**, then draw **1 Dawn Card**. Heroes may either start inside the Crypt (room 6\) or remain outside to craft/search. |
| **Day** | Each hero performs **3 actions** (move, search, rescue, craft, trade). |
| **Full Moon** | When the phase hand is **straight up**, draw **1 Moon Card**, then play Night as normal. |
| **Night** | Roll D16 to determine **vampire spawns**, resolve attacks, then apply current weather. |

*Revealing the **Awake Dracula** coffin immediately jumps to Full-Moon → Night.*

---

## **4 · Day-time Actions**

| Action | Cost | Note |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Move** | 0 AP\* | Adjacent room; moving *up or down* a stair node costs \+1. |
| **Search** | 1 AP | Trigger Memory-Search (see §8). |
| **Rescue** | 1 AP | Free a prisoner on D6 \= 4-6 or automatically with a **Key**. |
| **Craft** | 1 AP | At the *outside Crafting Board*: combine items (e.g. stick \+ knife \= stake) – D6 \= 4-6 unless **Quincey** (3-6). |
| **Trade** | 0 AP | Exchange items with a hero in the same room. |

\* You may only move once per character and turn but it does not consuma an AP.

---

## **5 · Damage, Sanity & Willpower**

Each hero tracks three D6 counters:

* **Health (HP)** – drop to 0 ⇒ hero dies; 1-2 ⇒ hero is captured & vampirised.  
* **Sanity** – governs fear tests; 0 ⇒ skip next turn.  
* **Willpower** – spent by specific Moon/Dawn effects.

A vial of **Holy Water** restores either 2 HP *or* breaks vampirism on a captured hero in a coffin.

---

## **6 · Items & Crafting Board**

| Item | Effect | Source |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Garlic** | Block 1 vampire attack, then discard. | Mina starts with one. |
| **Holy Water** | Heal or cleanse vampirism/trap. | Dr Seward starts with one / rare search. |
| **Cross** | Roll D16: repel vampire to a random room. | Van Helsing start item. |
| **Stick** | Combine at Crafting Board to make **Stake**. | Common search. |
| **Stake \+ Hammer** | Kill sleeping vampires (D6 \= 5-6). | Craft. |
| **Silver-Tipped Stake** | Only item that can kill Dracula. | Quincey crafts on D6 \= 3-6. |
| **Revolver** | Quincey unique – spend 1 bullet to auto-hit 1 vampire once/round. |  |
| **Wooden Club** | Godalming unique – may stake during **Day** if crafted. |  |
| **Key** | Auto-rescue prisoner / open Cage trap. | Jonathan start item. |

*Weather Interference:* During **Storm** no crafting is allowed; during **Thunder** no staking.

---

## **7 · Heroes & Personal Gear**

| Hero | Starting Gear | Ability |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Van Helsing** | Cross | May use Cross once per night for free. |
| **Dr Seward** | Holy Water | Heals 1 HP to another hero once per round. |
| **Quincey Morris** | Revolver | Crafts stakes on 3-6 instead of 4-6. |
| **Lord Godalming** | Wooden Club | May stake vampires during **Day** if outside. |
| **Mina Harker** | Garlic | Recovers 1 Sanity each Dawn. |
| **Jonathan Harker** | Key | Once per round reroll one D6. |

If a hero is reduced to 1-2 HP they become **infected** → place their pawn in a random coffin; they act as a vampire until healed with Holy Water.

---

## **8 · Memory-Search System**

1. Arrange the 160 cards face-down in a shared grid.  
     
2. Each room dial shows how many items remain (5 → 0).  
     
3. **Search**: flip **2** cards.  
     
   * **Match** ⇒ gain item (dial –1).  
   * **Trap Pair** ⇒ suffer trap.  
   * **No match** ⇒ replace both cards.

   

4. At least every second room contains one trap pair.

## **9 · Coffins, Vampires & Staking**

### 9.1 The Vampire Line-up

| Vampire | Coffin Token | Special Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Mary** – *White* | Sister 1 | Mournful; several Moon Cards reference **“Mary’s Calling”** (usually sanity loss or unwilling movement towards the Crypt). |
| **Sade** – *Red* | Sister 2 | Dominant; expect **“Marked by Sade”** effects that drain willpower or turn heroes against each other. |
| **Luci** – *Black* | Sister 3 | Dream-weaver; **“Touched by Luci”** triggers hallucinations, forcing difficult Memory-Searches. |
| **Count Dracula** | Awake / Sleeping | Cannot be killed until all three Sisters are staked; see Staking Table below. |

**Card Consistency:** Whenever Moon or Dawn card text mentions the sisters, always use their final names and tags above.

### 9.2 Coffin Set-up

* Shuffle 20 coffins face-down every Night.  
* Contents: Mary, Sade, Luci, 1 Awake Dracula, 1 Sleeping Dracula (added **only after the three Sisters are destroyed**), prisoners, blanks, traps.

### 9.3 Night Spawn & Attacks

* **Night Spawn:** roll D16 for each new vampire.  
* Resolve attacks (heroes choose order if multiple vampires strike the same room).

### 9.4 Staking Table

| Target | Requires | Success |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Sleeping Sister or Spawn | Stake \+ Hammer | D6 \= 5-6 |
| **Count Dracula** | **Silver-Tipped Stake \+ Hammer** (only after Sisters are dead) | D6 \= 5-6 |
| Infected Hero | Holy Water | Automatic |

*No staking is allowed during **Thunder** weather.*

---

## **10 · Weather Barometer**

At the start of **each Day and Night**:

1. Roll D6, rotate pointer clockwise.  
2. Apply the effect for the entire phase.

| Sector | Effect |
| :---- | :---- |
| **FAIR × 2** | No additional effect. |
| **STORM** | Day –1 round; Night \+1 round; no crafting. |
| **MIST** | Search success only on D6 \= 6; movement limited to 1 room if a Moon/Dawn card so states. |
| **THUNDER** | Heroes may not stake; Sisters’ attacks gain \+1 damage. |
| **CLOUD** *(centre)* | Shuffle 1 resolved Moon card back into its deck. |

---

## **11 · Moon & Dawn Cards (Digital Simulator)**

* **Infinite Digital Moon Cards** – nightmares, vampire events, negative twists.  
    
* **Infinite Digital Dawn Cards** – respite, rare blessings, cruel ironies.  
    
* Cards are displayed by the web-simulator: clicking the appropriate card back reveals **Title / Story / Effect** and automatically checks *weather tags* (✅ / ❌).  
    
* Card memory prevents repeats within a single game.  
    
* **Personality Tags:**  
    
  * **Mary** – guilt / mourning  
  * **Sade** – desire / dominance  
  * **Luci** – dreams / illusion Use these tags when designing new cards so their effects feel true to the Sister in question.

---

## **12 · Advanced Rules**

* **Crafting Board outside:** players may risk staying outside during Dawn to sharpen stakes; wolves (Moon card) or servants (Dawn card) can strike only if a hero is outside crafting.  
* **Captured Heroes:** Servants can drag a hero to the Dungeon (room 7\) during Day; hero misses next turn unless freed (Rescue / Key).  
* **Infected Heroes:** Cannot be killed until Dracula is dead; they count as vampires meanwhile.

---

## **13 · Solo Mode**

Play with **4 heroes**. Hero actions follow normal rules. Solo bonuses: start with **Garlic \+ Holy Water**. Crafting and rescue reroll thresholds lowered by 1\. Approximate win rate ≈ 40 %.

---

## **14 · Timing & Difficulty**

The game ends immediately once **60 Moon/Dawn cards** have been drawn. *Easy \= 70 cards · Normal \= 60 · Hard \= 50*. Average 4-player game: 90 min, win chance 30-35 %. The house favours Dracula.

---

Keep garlic close, dice closer, and always double-check new card designs against the **official PDF manual** to ensure perfect mechanical harmony. Happy staking\!
